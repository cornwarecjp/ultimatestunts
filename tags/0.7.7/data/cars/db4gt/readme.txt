Shortly after the presentation of the DB4, a compacter version called DB4 GT was introduced for racing purposes. The performance and the road holding are on the top for its time; anyway the traditional attention for the smallest details, which makes Aston Martin famous worldwide, was not forgotten.
The DB4 GT with this stock body designed by the coachbuilder Touring of Milan is not as famous as the one of Zagato, anyway sets the design cues for the future Aston Martins of the Sixties, nowadays considered the best Aston Martins of all the times.
