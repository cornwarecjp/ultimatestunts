<h1>Creating an Ultimate Stunts track from scratch</h1>
An essential part of the Stunts gameplay was that players had the ability to
create their own tracks with a track editor. As Ultimate Stunts is not yet
finished, the Ultimate Stunts track editor is not yet available. For those
people who really want to create their own tracks, here is a tutorial on how to
do that without a track editor.
<p>
Track files in Ultimate Stunts are simple text files with the extension .track,
and they are usually located in the tracks subdirectory of the data files. You
can simply open them in your favourite text editor, modify and save them. Note
that the tracks that are provided with the standard data files are UNIX-style
text files, which means that opening them in windows notepad might give
problems. Windows users can open them with wordpad. Saving as DOS-style text is
not a problem, as Ultimate Stunts can read both types of text files. I don't
think it can read Macintosh-style text files, so Apple-users should save either
in UNIX-style or in DOS-style.

<h3>File format basics</h3>
A detailed description of the track file format is available
<a href="fileformats.htm#track">here</a>. You will need all that information,
so I reccomend reading it.

<h1>Some tiles and textures we're going to use</h1>
A track is built of tiles, which use textures (images that are mapped on the
3D geometry). We need to define which tiles and textures will be used. There
are some tiles and textures available in the standard data files, and we'll use
some of them. First of all the textures:
<ul>
	<li>textures/grass2.jpg: Grass texture</li>
	<li>textures/road2.jpg: Road texture</li>
	<li>textures/concrete1.jpg: Concrete texture</li>
	<li>textures/startfinish.jpg: Start/Finish flag</li>
</ul>
Next, the tiles:
<ul>
	<li>tiles/empty.glb: Empty tile</li>
	<li>tiles/hjoriz.glb: Horizontal plane without roads</li>
	<li>tiles/corner.glb: Sharp corner</li>
	<li>tiles/roadhoriz.glb: Straight road</li>
	<li>tiles/startfinish.glb: Start/Finish tile</li>
</ul>

<h1>A simple track</h1>
I'll describe a simple track file here. It is available in the data files as
tracks/small.track. Let's start at the top of the file:
<pre>
TRACKFILE
4
5
1
</pre>
The first four lines of the file should always look like this. The TRACKFILE
text is used to check if the loaded file really is an Ultimate Stunts track. The
next three lines define the length, width and height of the track. These numbers
should always be consistent with the track description in the rest of the file.
If you change the sizes of the track, then you should also change these numbers
to match the new size.
<pre>
#properties:
length
width
heigth
</pre>
This is just a comment, it is ignored by the track loader. Actually, you could
write anything here, because the loader will ignore anything until it reads
BEGIN.
<pre>
BEGIN
textures/grass2.jpg
textures/road2.jpg
textures/concrete1.jpg
textures/startfinish.jpg
END
</pre>
This section describes which textures are loaded. Textures should always be of
a recognised file format (e.g. *.jpg or *.png), and their sizes should always
be powers of 2 (4, 8, 16 etc.). Textures with alpha channel are also supported.
<pre>
BEGIN
sky = environment/clouds.rgba
horizon = environment/kyoto-horizon.png
envmap = environment/spheremap.rgb
lightdir = -0.69,-0.7,-0.2
lightcol = 0.2,0.2,0.5
ambientcol = 0.0,0.0,0.0
skycol = 0.3,0.3,0.8
horizonskycol = 0.9,0.9,0.9
fogcol = 0.6,0.6,0.35
envcol = 1,1,1
END
</pre>
In this section, the environment settings are loaded, like background and
lighting settings. The exact meaning of these lines
is documented in the <a href="fileformats.htm#track">track file format
documentation</a>. You can find examples in existing track files, and you
can experiment with different values.
<pre>
BEGIN
tiles/empty.glb 0
tiles/horiz.glb 0
tiles/corner.glb 0 1
tiles/roadhoriz.glb 0 1
tiles/startfinish.glb:sf 0 1 2 3
END
</pre>
Here, the tiles are loaded. Every line consists of the tile filename and a list
of numbers. These numbers refer to the textures that should be used by the
tile. 0 is the first texture, 1 the second etc.. For example, the horizontal
plane tiles/horiz.glb is loaded with the grass texture on it. The straight road
tile tiles/roadhoriz.glb is loaded with a grass and a road texture. The order in
which you refer to the textures does matter. For instance, if you change
"tiles/roadhoriz.glb 0 1" to "tiles/roadhoriz.glb 1 0", then it would become a
completely asphalted tile with a band of grass in the middle of it.
<p>
Be aware that if you point to too few textures for a tile, that a memory access
fault, or a segmentation fault, can occur. The same thing can happen if you
point to a texture that does not exist, for example if you point to nr 10 while
you only loaded 5 textures.
<p>
The last line of this section shows something interesting: after the tile
filename, it says ":sf". This means that this tile is used as a start/finish
tile.
<pre>
#tile_id/rotation/heigth
</pre>
Just another comment. As you can see, you can write comments between END and
BEGIN. Now the most important section begins:
<pre>
BEGIN
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/3/0	2/2/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	4/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/0/0	2/1/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
END
</pre>
Here the track itself is described. Every tile location is described by a set
of three numbers. The whole section is a "top-view" of the map. As you can see,
this track has 5 lines of 4 tiles, which is exactly the size mentioned at the
begin of the file. It is important that before each tile there is whitespace
consisting of exactly one <i>tab</i>. Anything else, like spaces, is wrong.
You should check if your text editor converts tabs to spaces, and disable that
feature if possible.
<p>
The first of the three numbers refers to one of the loaded tiles. 0 refers to
the first tile, 1 to the second etc.. As you can see, the tiles at the edges of
the track all have a 1, which is the horizontal plane without roads. In the
middle 3x2 tiles you can see four times a 2, which is the sharp corner tile,
one time a 3 (straight road) and a 4 (start/finish). Now you should have an
idea of what the track looks like.
<p>
The second number defines the rotation. 0 is a non-rotated tile, 1 means a 90
degree counterclockwise rotation, 2 a 180 degree rotation, and 3 is a 270
degree counterclockwise rotation, which of course equals 90 degree clockwise.
As you can see, the straight road and the start/finish tile have their original
orientation. The corner tiles each have another orientation of course. Sometimes
trial and error is the quickest way to find the correct orientation.
<p>
The third number is the vertical position of the tile. As this is a simple
track, every tile is located at the same height.
<pre>

BEGIN
2,2,0:0.0
2,1,0:2.0
1,1,0:4.0
1,2,0:6.0
1,3,0:8.0
2,3,0:10.0
2,2,0:12.0
END
</pre>
This section describes the route that cars should follow. If cars do not follow this route,
then they will get penalty time.
<p>
Every entry in this section consists of three indices (separated by commas), a ":", and then
a time. The three indices point to a certain tile, and the time is used to calculate penalty
time. See also the track format definition.

<h1>Extending the track</h1>
The described track file is a completely valid track file, but it is quite
silly, so let's extend it a little. First of all, let's make it a little longer,
by modifying the track section:
<pre>
BEGIN
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/3/0	2/2/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	4/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/0/0	2/1/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
END
</pre>
Now you should also alter the numbers at the beginning of the file to:
<pre>
TRACKFILE
4
10
1
</pre>
This adds some straight road tiles. That should not be too difficult to
understand. Now we advance to the next level:

<h3>Creating height differences</h3>
We're going to create a hill. In order to do that, we need some new tile types
for the slopes. Change the tile section to this:
<pre>
BEGIN
tiles/empty.glb 0
tiles/horiz.glb 0
tiles/corner.glb 0 1
tiles/roadhoriz.glb 0 1
tiles/startfinish.glb:sf 0 1 2 3
tiles/diag2.glb 0
tiles/roaddiag.glb 0 1
END
</pre>
diag2.glb is a slope without a road, and roaddiag.glb is a slope with a road on it.
Now we can change the track section to:
<pre>
BEGIN
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/3/0	2/2/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	5/2/0	6/2/0	6/2/0	5/2/0
	1/0/1	3/0/1	3/0/1	1/0/1
	5/0/0	6/0/0	6/0/0	5/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	4/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/0/0	2/1/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
END
</pre>
This has a lot of changes compared to the previous example, so I'll try to
explain it here. First of all, the tile ID numbers. The new numbers 5 and 6
refer to the new tiles diag2.glb and roaddiag.glb. You can see that I replaced
the 1's with 5's and the 3's with 6's to get the slopes. Next, the rotation
number. The "south" slope has rotation 0, because the slope tiles just happen
to have the right orientation for that slope. The "north" slope has exactly the
opposite orientation, so the 180 degree rotation is used.
<p>
Last, but not least, I'd like to explain the height number. Although the slopes
are higher than the ground, they still have a height number of 0. That's
because height 0 means that the tile geometry is between 0 and 12 meter above
the ground, and height 1 means between 12 and 24 meter, and so on. The slope is
in the range 0..12 meter, so its height number is 0. The height number
<i>does</i> change for the tiles in the middle of the hill. As the ground level
of these tiles is at the bottom of the tile, it needs to be lifted 1 tile unit
(12 meter) in order to match the top height of the slopes. Try setting it to 0,
if you don't understand me. You'll see what happens.

<h1>Multiple layers</h1>
So far so good. But what if you want to place multiple tiles on top of each
other? You'll want to do that many times in Ultimate Stunts, because tiles have
a height limitation. Also, this will give you the flexibility to build
bridges on top of each other, and to build tunnels below other roads. The
possibility to place tiles on top of each other is one of the advantages of
Ultimate Stunts over the original Stunts game.
<p>
So, how is it done? The basic idea is to define more than one track section.
This is an example:
<pre>
TRACKFILE
4
10
2

#properties:
length
width
heigth

BEGIN
textures/grass2.jpg
textures/road2.jpg
textures/concrete1.jpg
textures/startfinish.jpg
END

BEGIN
sky = environment/sky3.rgb
horizon = environment/kyoto-horizon.png
envmap = environment/spheremap.rgb
lightdir = -0.69,-0.7,-0.2
lightcol = 0.2,0.2,0.5
ambientcol = 0.0,0.0,0.0
skycol = 0.1,0.1,0.5
END

BEGIN
tiles/empty.glb 0
tiles/horiz.glb 0
tiles/corner.glb 0 1
tiles/roadhoriz.glb 0 1
tiles/startfinish.glb:sf 0 1 2 3
END

#tile_id/rotation/heigth

BEGIN
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/3/0	2/2/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	4/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/0/0	2/1/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
END

BEGIN
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
END
</pre>
First of all, take a look at the height number at the start of the file. It is
now 2, because we have 2 layers. In your own tracks, you can use any number of
layers, as long as it matches the number at the beginning of the file.
<p>
As you can see, I've filled the second layer with empty tiles (0 referring to
tiles/empty.glb). When you work with multiple layers, you will use the empty tile
many times, because you'll only need the extra layers at some locations.
Recent Ultimate Stunts versions have an optimalisation that stops rendering once
a tile ID of 0 is found. This means that the track builder needs to take care
of two things:
<ul>
	<li>Tile ID 0 (the first tile) <u>always</u> needs to be the empty
		tile</li>
	<li>If not all layers are used at a certain location, then only the
		<u>bottom</u> layers should be used, and the top layers should
		conatin the empty tiles.</li>
</ul>
Ultimate Stunts assumes that the first layer contains the lowest tiles, the
second layer contains tiles placed on top of them, etc.. So the height number
of a tile in the second layer should always be greater than the height number
of the same location in the first layer. Ultimate Stunts does not yet check
this, so you might get (rendering) errors if you don't follow this rule.
<p>
We will use this knowledge to build a tunnel. But before we can do that, we need
to load a texture for the walls of the tunnel, and the tunnel tiles themselves:
<pre>
BEGIN
textures/grass2.jpg
textures/road2.jpg
textures/concrete1.jpg
textures/startfinish.jpg
textures/bricks2.jpg
textures/road1.jpg
END

BEGIN
sky = environment/sky3.rgb
horizon = environment/kyoto-horizon.png
envmap = environment/spheremap.rgb
lightdir = -0.69,-0.7,-0.2
lightcol = 0.2,0.2,0.5
ambientcol = 0.0,0.0,0.0
skycol = 0.1,0.1,0.5
END

BEGIN
tiles/empty.glb 0
tiles/horiz.glb 0
tiles/corner.glb 0 1
tiles/roadhoriz.glb 0 1
tiles/startfinish.glb:sf 0 1 2 3
tiles/tunnelin1.glb 0 5 4 2
tiles/tunnelhoriz.glb 5 4 2
tiles/diag2.glb 0
END
</pre>
We've loaded an extra texture for the walls (bricks2.jpg), and one for the road
inside the tunnel (road1.jpg), which is slightly different from the one used
outside the tunnel. The new tiles are tunnelin1.glb, which is the tunnel entrance
tile, tunnelhoriz.glb, which is a normal straight tunnel tile, and diag2.glb,
which we already know. Now we can define the first layer:
<pre>
BEGIN
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/3/0	2/2/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	7/2/0	5/2/0	5/2/0	7/2/0
	1/0/1	6/0/0	6/0/0	1/0/1
	7/0/0	5/0/0	5/0/0	7/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	3/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	3/0/0	4/0/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	2/0/0	2/1/0	1/0/0
	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0	1/0/0
END
</pre>
We've made two slopes with tunnel entrances, and the tunnel inside. We've also
added the horizontal plane ground on top of the hill, on the left and the right.
Now you can see why we need two layers: we also want grass above the tunnels.
That's done in the second layer:
<pre>
BEGIN
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	1/0/1	1/0/1	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10	0/0/10
END
</pre>
That's the trick! Now you can create viaducts, loopings, and all other sorts of
things that require multiple layers. The only thing you need to find out now
is what sorts of tiles are available. It might help to take a look inside
test.track. Test.track is used as a "test-site" for new tiles, so most
tiles are used in that track.

<h1>The track route</h1>
I would like to explain how the penalty time system works, but unfortunately this
is quite complicated, and it is likely to change soon in the future. So, I
decided that that would take too much time. Maybe you can read the track file
format definition, and experiment a bit. If you don't run Ultimate Stunts in
fullscreen mode, then you can see in the console messages about the rule
status.
