<h1>Compilation of Ultimate Stunts</h1>

In a perfect world, compilation would be the same on all OS platforms.
However, there are some differences that make compilation a bit
harder on some systems. Ultimate Stunts is developed under Linux, and
will typically compile best on Linux or similar UNIX-style systems. It
can also be compiled on some other systems:
<ul>
	<li>On windows, <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> can be
	used as a UNIX environment. You can download Cygwin with all the
	required packages (see below) and follow the instructions in
	the rest of this document. UltimateStunts will be kept portable 
	with Cygwin during it's development.</li>

	<li>While Mac OS X is based on a UNIX-kernel, Apple has added a lot
	of "features" that make it less compatible with typical UNIX
	systems. A separate <a href="macosx.htm">compilation manual for Mac OS X
	</a> is	available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

To compile UltimateStunts, you'll need a UNIX-compatible
system with a c/c++ compiler. You'll also need the
program 'make', and a shell-program able to execute the
configure-script.
<p>
Of course you should also have the right library's and development-packages
installed. The programs that use graphics need the openGL, SDL and SDL_image libraries
(and things needed by openGL and SDL). The non-graphical programs (such as the
server) can also use SDL, but it may be possible to compile them without SDL.
Sound support using the FMOD or the OpenAL library is optional: if you don't
have FMOD or openAL, Ultimate Stunts will compile without sound support. if you
have both, Ultimate Stunts will use OpenAL by default.<br>
<p>
You can find the necessary libraries here:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.fmod.org/ifmoddownload.html">FMOD</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.openal.org/downloads.html">OpenAL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php">SDL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL_image</a></li>
</ul>
If you want to use OpenAL, don't forget to install the ALUT library too.
<p>
Most Linux distributions provide the necessary libraries as packages. Usually,
FMOD is not included (as it is non-free software), but you can always use OpenAL
as an alternative. If you install these libraries through a package-management system,
don't forget to install the development packages: they are necessary for compiling
Ultimate Stunts (for running it, you only need the runtime packages). To give you an
idea of what kind of packages to install, these are the package names in Kubuntu 6.06:
<ul>
	<li>libsdl1.2debian</li>
	<li>libsdl1.2-dev</li>
	<li>libsdl-image1.2</li>
	<li>libsdl-image1.2-dev</li>
	<li>libopenal0a</li>
	<li>libopenal-dev</li>
	<li>libalut0</li>
	<li>libalut-dev</li>
</ul>

<h3>Libraries for Cygwin</h3>
Because getting the libraries for Cygwin can be difficult, I
decided to help you by providing Cygwin-packages for
<a href="http://www.ultimatestunts.nl/documentation/nolanguage/sdlcygwin.tgz">SDL and SDL_image</a>, and for
<a href="http://www.ultimatestunts.nl/documentation/nolanguage/fmod-3.73-cygwin.tgz">FMOD</a>.
They should be extracted in the Cygwin root directory, and then they will be
ready to be used by Ultimate Stunts.

<h3>FMOD header files</h3>
Ultimate Stunts assumes that the FMOD header files can be found in a
subdirectory "fmod" somewhere in the default include search path. A good place
to put fmod.h etc. would be /usr/include/fmod. The FMOD shared object file can
be placed e.g. in /usr/lib. Ultimate Stunts expects libfmod.so to be present,
so maybe you need to create a symlink (like "ln -s libfmod-371.so libfmod.so").

<h3>Compiling</h3>
Problems during compilation can be very difficult to solve if you are not a
developer, but as long as it doesn't give any problems, compiling is simple.
<p>
First of all you should have downloaded the source package, and
have it extracted in a directory. Then, Ultimate Stunts should
be configured for compiling on your system. So, run the configure-
script:
<pre>
./configure
</pre>
If everything has worked well, the configure-script has made some
files with the name "Makefile". This enables "make" to do the
compiling automatically for you. Start make with the following
command:
<pre>
make
</pre>
Make will first compile all code that is shared between the different
programs. Then it will compile program-specific code and link it all
together to form the program binaries. The resulting binaries are located
in the program-specific directories.
<pre>
make install
</pre>
The "make install" stage is not necessary for testing the game: you can
already run Ultimate Stunts from the source directory with ./execselect.sh
or ./ultimatestunts/ustunts. "make install" installs the binaries and data
files. It assumes a UNIX-style directory layout, so on other operating
systems a manual installation may be more useful. You must run this command
as super-user (root). The default locations for the files are
/usr/local/bin for the binaries and /usr/local/share/ultimatestunts. After
"make install", users can start Ultimate Stunts with the command ustunts
(if the location of the binaries is in the user's PATH variable, of course).

<h3>DLL files</h3>
<p>
Windows users who want to start their binary's from the explorer,
from the start menu or any other usual way, should know that all
cygwin programs need cygwin1.dll. The ultimatestunts binary also
needs SDL.dll and fmod.dll. Find those files, and place them e.g.
in the same directory as the binaries. For starting a networked
multiplaying game, some tweaking of the PATH variable may be
necessary. See the windows binary package for how I solved it.
