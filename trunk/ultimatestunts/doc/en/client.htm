<h1>Using the Ultimate Stunts version 0.6.x program</h1>

When the ultimatestunts program is started, music playback starts, and a
menu interface appears. You can start playing immediately, or first change
some things, like cars/players and the track.

<h1>Playing</h1>
When you choose to start playing, the data files are loaded. Depending on
your hardware, this might take some time. When all data is loaded, the game
starts. The controls of the game (keys, joystick etc.) can be set in the
ultimatestunts.conf file. This is the default for one player:
<ul>
	<li>Arrow keys: accelerate, brake and steer</li>
	<li>right shift/right ctrl: Gear up/down, including the reverse gear</li>
	<li>Esc: exit the game</li>
	<li>right alt: change camera mode</li>
	<li>/: change camera target car</li>
	<li>F1: play the next song in the playlist</li>
</ul>
After exiting the game, crashing or finishing, the hiscore of the track
is displayed, and you can optionally choose to view or save a replay of this
race. If you have reached the first place for this track, then the replay is
automatically saved with the same name as the track.

<h1>Other functions</h1>
<h3>Selecting a track</h3>
If you want to play on another track, then you can select a track with that option in
the main menu.

<h3>Selecting players and cars</h3>
You can select the players, and the cars they drive, in the Player selection menu, which
can be accessed from the main menu:

You can either add a player, or change an existing player in the list. Changing the
player's settings or deleting the player is done in the individual player menu, which
can be accessed by selecting a player in the player selection menu:

Split screen multiplaying (up to four players) is possible by adding multple human
players to the list.

<h3>Viewing a replay</h3>
You can select this function from the main menu, select a replay file, and then the
files are loaded, and you can view the replay file.

<h1>Multiplaying over a network</h1>
Ultimate Stunts uses a client-server model for network multiplaying. This means that
an Ultimate Stunts gameserver program needs to be started somewhere, so that different
computers can login to it. You can start the ustuntsserver program manually, and
control it with the console interface, but you can also let it start automatically
from the game menus. We will only consider this last option here: the server program
is documented elsewhere.
<p>
For a networked multiplaying game, the game type needs to be changed, as its default
setting is "local game". This is the game type menu:

<h3>The host player</h3>
First of all, one of the players (preferrably the one with the fastest computer and
network connection) starts a new network game. After some questions are answered by the
user, a server process is started automatically. Ultimate Stunts asks fort the following
things before a server can be started:
<ul>
	<li><b>The port number</b>. In most cases, the default should work. Sometimes a
	different port number needs to be chosen, e.g. to work around firewall rules. If
	you are looking for free port numbers on your machine, then you should look for
	UDP port numbers, as Ultimate Stunts uses UDP instead of TCP. On some systems, it
	is not possible to use port numbers lower than 1024. All clients should login
	using the same port number as in the server settings.
	</li><li><b>A name for the server</b>. The name is used so that other players can
	select the right server if more than one Ultimate Stunts server runs on the
	network, e.g. on a LAN-party.
	</li><li><b>The minimum number of players</b>. The game will not start until this
	minimum number of players is reached.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>All other players</h3>
Then, all other players need to join the game that has been created. After selecting the port
number, Ultimate Stunts searches for servers on the local network. This will take several
seconds. If no server is found, then you can try to select the server manually by entering the
hostname or IP-number of the server. This may be necessary if the server is somewhere far away
on the internet, or even when the server is in another subnet.
<p>
If one server is found, Ultimate Stunts automatically connects to that server. if more than one
server is found, then the user can select one from a menu.
