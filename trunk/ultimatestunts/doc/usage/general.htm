<h1>How to use Ultimate Stunts 0.5.x</h1>

<h3>Which packages?</h3>
To use UltimateStunts, you will need both the program files 
and the data files. If you are a windows user, you can use
the windows installation program to get both. Else (e.g.
if you are a Linux user), you can make your own binaries by
downloading the sourcecode and compiling it.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
When ultimatestunts is started, it searches for a configuration file called
"ultimatestunts.conf". Currently, this file should be located in the "current"
directory (.). The location of the datafiles directory is
normally defined in ultimatestunts.conf, as the value of "datadir". You
might want to edit this value. Other configuration in this file might be
interesting too.

<h3>A game session</h3>
In version 0.5.x, the server and the independent AI client
have not been written, so the only thing you can do is start the graphical
client, called "ultimatestunts". This program is able to do everything you
need, including AI players and the physics.
<p>
Before using the graphical client, please read the graphical client
documentation.

<h3>P.S.</h3>
The latest update of this document was written while 0.5.1 was the latest
version. Computer opponents (=the corresponding client programs) have not
been developed yet. However, a "dummy" AI player, just driving circles, has
been added in this version.
