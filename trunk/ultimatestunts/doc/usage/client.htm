<h1>Using the Ultimate Stunts version 0.5.x graphical client program</h1>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Ultimatestunts can be configured by editing the file "ultimatestunts.conf".
This file should currently be placed in the directory from which the program
is started. Future versions will also look on different places, like
"$HOME/.ultimatestunts/".
In "ultimatestunts.conf" data is stored in the same syntax as windows
.ini-files:
<pre>
#Comment
[sectionname]
..
option_name = value
..
</pre>
In the supplied ultimatestunts.conf files, options are explained with
comment lines.
<p>
An option that needs special attention is the datadir-option. This option
(default value: ".") should point to the directory where you placed your
data files. E.g. if you placed your data files in /usr/share/stunts,
then the datadir option should be:
<pre>
[files]
datadir=/usr/share/stunts
</pre>
Windows users, using the binary programs compiled by cygwin, should be aware
that it is not (yet) possible to fill in the usual windows pathname. E.g.
if your data are stored in "C:\programs\ultimatestunts", then you can't
just fill in that. Instead, you should write
<pre>
datadir=/cygdrive/c/programs/ultimatestunts
</pre>
Spaces in file names possibly give problems, but it's also possible that
it just works (I didn't check it). Using relative path names is allowed,
e.g. "." is the current directory.

<h3>Usage</h3>
When the ultimatestunts program is started, music playback starts, and a
menu interface appears. You can start
playing immediately, or first select cars/players and the track.
<p>
When you choose to start playing, the data files are loaded. Depending on
your hardware, this might take some time. When all data is loaded, the game
starts. The controls of the game (keys, joystick etc.) can be set in
ultimatestunts.conf. This is the default for one player:
<ul>
	<li>Arrow keys: accelerate, brake and steer</li>
	<li>right shift/right ctrl: Gear up/down, including the reverse gear</li>
	<li>Esc: exit the program</li>
	<li>right alt: change camera mode</li>
	<li>/: change camera target car</li>
	<li>F1: play the next song in the playlist</li>
</ul>
</body></html>
