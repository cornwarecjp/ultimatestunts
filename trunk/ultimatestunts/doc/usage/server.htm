<h1>Using the Ultimate Stunts server program 0.5.x</h1>

<h3>Starting the program</h3>
To use the server, just start the "stuntsserver" program. You can set initial
values on the commandline with the syntax <i>variable=value</i>. For example:
<pre>
stuntsserver port=1600
</pre>
Values that can be set on the commandline can also be changed within the program. The
advantage of the commandline is that you know the initial value. For example, if some
other application has already reserved the default port number 1500, then the stuntsserver
program might fail to start when the port number is not changed on the commandline.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Directly after starting the server, it start listening on the network port so
that clients can connect to it. Every time a client is added, this will be
displayed to you.<br>
While waiting for clients to be added, you can give commands to the server. The
"help" command shows which commands are available on your version of the server.
<p>
Usually, you should do the following things in this order:
<ul>
	<li>Start the server program. It is recommended to set the <i>port</i> and
	<i>maxRequests</i> variables on the commandline if you need to change them.</li>

	<li>Then (optionally) set the <i>port</i> and <i>maxRequests</i> variables if you
	still need to do that. <i>port</i> is the UDP port number where client programs can
	connect to, and <i>maxRequests</i> is the maximum number of remote players that is
	allowed to join a	game.</li>

	<li>Now you can tell all the players that they can join the game</li>

	<li>You can select a track by setting the <i>track</i> variable</li>
	<li>You can add AI players with the "addai" command</li>

	<li>When all players have pushed the "start game" button, then you can give the
	"start" command</li>

	<li>The game can be stopped with the "stop" command</li>

	<li>You can repeat the last steps if you wish to</li>

	<li>You can terminate the server program with "exit" or "quit"</li>
</ul>
