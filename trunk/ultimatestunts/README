                Ultimate Stunts source code
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains the sourcecode of the 3D racing game 
"Ultimate Stunts". You can configure it and compile it according
to the instructions in the documentation.

Ultimate Stunts, data files for Ultimate Stunts and the documentation
of Ultimate Stunts are available on its website:
http://ultimatestunts.sourceforge.net

The source code in this package is divided in several directories.
The code in the directories "shared", "filetransfer", "graphics" and
"simulation" is compiled into *.a static libraries. The code in the
directories "stunts3dedit", "stuntsai", "stuntsserver", "trackedit" and
"ultimatestunts" will be linked with those static libraries, generating
a different binary executable in each directory.

The source code can be edited with kdevelop. The kdevprj-file is available
in this directory. Note that this is a "custom"-type project, which means
that kdevelop does not modify Makefile.am and configure.in for you.
Automake, autoconf, configure and make can still be done from the kdevelop
menus.
