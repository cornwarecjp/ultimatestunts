Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS Cabriolet Pininfarina

6 cylinder DOHC, 2.5-Liter, 110 bhp
Top speed: 165 km/h

The 6C 2500 is the last of the legendary Alfa 6C models that won everything it was possible in the thirties, as well as the last Alfa Romeo to use a separate ladder frame. Even though the engine is not so big, the performance was very interesting for its time. Road holding was also typically Alfa Romeo, combining a high corner speed with a very precise steering.

This bodystyle comes from Pininfarina and is one of the most attractive and elegant, interpreting the character of the Grand Tourer in the best way.
